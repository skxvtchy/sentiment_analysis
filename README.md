### Creating AWS lambda

- run `mkdir lambda_package` in terminal should be in root dir
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt -t lambda_package/`
- run `cp -r app/* lambda_package/` to copy the contents of your `app` directory into `lambda_package`
- `cd lambda_package` then `zip -r ../aws_lambda_artifact.zip .` \*if you dont have zip in git do it in your wsl terminal
- if file too big upload it to s3 and link it to lamda which is what i did
- file might still be too big should implement another api service ngl

`git rev-list --objects --all | grep -f <(git rev-list --objects --all | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -d | awk '{print $1}')`
